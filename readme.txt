This plugin allows bloggers to sync recipe reviews from the Spillt App to the author's blog, and sync links to their recipes into the Spillt App.

== Description ==
This plugin requires WP Recipe Maker, Tasty Recipes, or Mediavine Create, and requires the blogger to have created an account on Spillt's mobile app.

On your blog, the Spillt plugin syncs reviews of your recipes to your site, and also posts the link to any new recipes that you publish on Spillt.

See our website for [more information](https://spillt.co/faqs/).
